    "# Namespace\n",
    "A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python.\n",
    "An object might be a variable or a method.\n",
    "Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.\n",
    "the Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace. So, the division of the word itself gives a little more information.\n",
    "Its Name (which means name, a unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope).\n",
    "Here, a name might be of any Python method or variable and space depends upon the location from where is trying to access a variable or a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of namespaces :\n",
    "When Python interpreter runs solely without any user-defined modules, methods, classes, etc. Some functions like print(), id() are always present, these are built-in namespaces.\n",
    "When a user creates a module, a global namespace gets created, later the creation of local functions creates the local namespace.\n",
    "The built-in namespace encompasses the global namespace and the global namespace encompasses the local namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scope of variable\n",
    "The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable. "
